Off Road navigation system like similiar in function to waze but superior in ways to organize trips by 4x4 car, bike or hiking.

Taking inspiration from popular features across popular apps and innovating in some:
* People are able to share location and their unique features for others to see
* Mark a few locations and the app will recommend a route in which to take - depends on the type of transportation dictated by the user - (No app has done this :( )
* General route planning features and saving these for later use
* Offline use - Map downloads, route saving. (No cellular reception)
* Social feature - Forums for discussing routes and sharing them, or just a whole other tab for popular routes people take? - I dunno
